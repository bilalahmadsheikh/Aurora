## What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing is an emerging field that leverages principles of quantum mechanics — like superposition and entanglement — to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers.

Instead of bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use **qubits**, which can represent 0 *and* 1 simultaneously.

> A 300-qubit system represents more states than atoms in the observable universe.

## Core Concepts

- **Superposition**: A qubit exists in multiple states until it’s measured.
- **Entanglement**: Qubits become linked, so the state of one affects the other — even at distance.
- **Quantum gates**: Operations on qubits that change their state using complex numbers and probabilities.
- **Measurement**: Collapses a qubit's state into a classical bit.

## Real-World Applications

Quantum computing promises breakthroughs in:

- **Cryptography** – Breaking RSA encryption using Shor’s algorithm.
- **Drug discovery** – Simulating molecular interactions precisely.
- **Optimization** – Solving supply chain, logistics, and traffic flow challenges.
- **Artificial Intelligence** – Enhancing probabilistic machine learning.

## Limitations and Challenges

- **Qubit decoherence**: Qubits lose their quantum state quickly due to environmental noise.
- **Error correction**: Quantum information is fragile and difficult to stabilize.
- **Hardware limitations**: Scaling to practical numbers of qubits is nontrivial.
- **Cost**: Most quantum systems require near absolute zero temperatures.
