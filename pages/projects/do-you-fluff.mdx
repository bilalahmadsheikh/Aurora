## Technologies

This research utilizes large-scale genome sequencing, machine learning algorithms, and advanced data visualization tools—all built on the modern web stack: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Data processing is powered by Python pipelines, cloud compute (AWS Lambda & GCP), and interactive dashboards built with D3.js and Plotly.

We’ve integrated MDX using [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote), enabling a dynamic documentation layer with embedded visuals and code.

## Why it Matters

Our genome contains over 3 billion base pairs—unlocking its secrets could mean early cancer detection, personalized drug response, and understanding rare genetic diseases.

This project bridges **computational biology** and **clinical research** to build a better understanding of how genes interact, mutate, and express across populations.

## Data & Tools

We pull open-access datasets like:

- [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
- [NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)
- [Ensembl Genome Browser](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)

With machine learning powered by:

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- TensorFlow (for genomic pattern recognition)
- Jupyter + Streamlit (for prototyping)
