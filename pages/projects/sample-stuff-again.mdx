## Overview

Microbes outnumber human cells 10 to 1, and their role in climate regulation, agriculture, and human health is only beginning to be understood.

This project investigates microbial biodiversity across ecosystems—from Arctic permafrost to coral reefs—and how these communities respond to environmental changes.

We collect samples, sequence DNA using metagenomics, and visualize microbial interactions using network science tools.

## Tools & Technologies

We use:

- **Oxford Nanopore MinION** for in-field sequencing
- **QIIME 2** for microbiome analysis
- **Cytoscape** and **Gephi** for microbial network modeling
- **Python** (NumPy, Biopython, SciPy) and **R** for statistical inference
- **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX** for dynamic documentation

All datasets are published in open repositories and made accessible via web dashboards.

## Applications

Understanding microbial networks helps in:

- Predicting ecosystem resilience to climate change
- Developing probiotics tailored to individual gut flora
- Bioremediation using engineered bacteria

We work closely with environmental and medical research institutes to turn lab discoveries into real-world solutions.
