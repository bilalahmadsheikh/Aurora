The future of deep space exploration may not rely solely on chemical propulsion. Our research focuses on using **solar sails** to harness the momentum of solar wind — a stream of charged particles from the sun — as a means to propel spacecraft without fuel.

Inspired by how a sailboat catches wind on Earth, a solar sail reflects photons and solar particles, transferring momentum to the spacecraft. Though weak in force, this thrust accumulates over time, offering significant speed gains with no mass consumption.

## Core Concepts

- **Photon pressure**: Light has no mass, but carries momentum.
- **Solar sail design**: Ultra-thin, reflective materials like Kapton or Mylar are used.
- **Trajectory control**: Orientation of the sail controls acceleration direction.
- **Longevity**: Continuous thrust allows interstellar missions that chemical rockets can't sustain.

## Experiments and Simulations

We conduct:

- **Vacuum chamber tests** simulating solar pressure.
- **Orbital mechanics simulations** using Python and MATLAB.
- **Deployable sail prototypes** using CubeSat platforms.
- Collaborations with space agencies (ESA, JAXA) on missions like **IKAROS** and **LightSail 2**.

## Real-World Potential

Solar sails can:

- Extend satellite lifetimes by counteracting orbital decay.
- Enable lightweight probes to reach outer planets.
- Support long-duration missions to Alpha Centauri or beyond.
